            <p>
              Pragmatic full stack software developer with 20 years experience specialising in building and delivering
              high quality bespoke software applications. I've been freelance since 2014.
            </p>

            <p>
              I’ve been writing JS since 2001 which has given me an excellent platform in all things JS. I’ve been using
              React for all front end projects since 2016.
            </p>

            <p>
              I've been working in React Native for building iOS and Android apps since early 2017, most recently
              delivering an app for a job matching startup and another for an established global marketing system.
            </p>

            <p>
              In terms of backend, I’ve been focusing on writing C# on .NET since around 2007. I’ve used MVC extensively
              during that time but more recently migrated to writing React based single page apps backing into various
              APIs.
            </p>

            <p>
              I have lots of experience in database design, maintenace, optimisation and migration. I started my career
              working with NoSQL databases but more recently have been focusing on SQL based, primarily MS SQL and
              MySQL.

          <h3 class="border-bottom mt-3 pb-1">Career Summary/Other Skills</h3>
          <p>
            I started as a junior dev at a small software company in 1999 building thick client apps but transitioned
            into web apps around 2001 and have remained almost solely focused on the browser since then.
          </p>

          <p>
            I have extensive experience of every aspect of the software application lifecycle, from requirements
            gathering with key stakeholders, system architecture, design, development, deployment, delivery and
            documentation through to ongoing maintenance and user support.
          </p>

          <p>
            Working for a small company means wearing lots of different hats and dealing with all kinds of different
            levels within client businesses. Whether negotiating at board level, dealing with business stakeholders to
            ensure expectations are set/met, liasing with project managers to make sure software is delivered to spec
            and on time or providing support to actual end users, I’ve done all of those and more. Due to that
            experience, I think communication is one of my particular strong points.

          <em class="text-muted">2019 - 2020</em>
          <p class="mt-2">
            This client has a very well established enterprise SaaS app which provides marketing planning and budget
            management. The system is used by companies such as McAfee, Intel, Visa, Qlik, Seagate. It's always been
            accessed via a browser only but they decided to offer a native mobile version offering much of the same
            functionality available through the successful browser app.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was primarily engaged to build the mobile app using React Native but I also became heaviliy involved in
            influencing and evolving their existing API in order for additional consumption by the new mobile app.

            <p>
              I'm a dedicated father of 2 boys (ages 5 &amp; 7) who keep me and my wife on our toes at all times!
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm a keen runner (although not very good!) and generally like to keep fit. Me and my 2 boys are often out
              on our bikes. I played football at a good level when I was younger and still try to play nowadays when I
              can. I enjoy watching any sport if I get the chance.
            </p>
            <p>
              I enjoy reading (although don't get to do it as much as I'd like these days) and listening to a few
              podcasts.
            </p>
            <p>
              I try to keep up to speed with the latest tech developments from a career perspective but also because I'm
              generally a little bit of a geek!
