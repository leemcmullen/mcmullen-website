            <h3 class="border-bottom mt-3 pb-1">Technical Summary</h3>
            <p>
              With over 20 years of experience as a pragmatic full-stack software engineer, I specialize in crafting and delivering high-quality bespoke software solutions. My expertise centres on developing browser and mobile applications.
            </p>

            <p>
              Since 2014, I've thrived in the freelance/contracting space, showcasing my proficiency in JavaScript and more recently, TypeScript. From 2016, I've exclusively employed React and associated libraries, including Redux, React Router, MaterialUI, and React Query, for all front-end projects.
            </p>

            <p>
              I began working with React Native in 2017, where I've contributed to diverse projects, such as a work and time tracking SaaS app, a high-end wine trading platform, and a connected car mobile app for Honda's electric vehicles.
            </p>

            <p>
              On the back-end, my journey with C# on .NET dates back to 2007, evolving with technologies like MVC, WebAPI, and more recently, .NET Core. I bring extensive API design, implementation, and consumption experience, with recent forays into NodeJS projects deployed on AWS. 
            </p>

            <p>
              Database design, maintenance, optimization, and migration have been integral aspects of my career, encompassing both SQL (e.g., MS SQL, MySQL) and NoSQL (e.g., DynamoDB) databases.

        <div class="col-sm-6 bg-white">
          <h3 class="border-bottom mt-3 pb-1">Other Skills</h3>
          <p>
            I have extensive experience across the entire software application lifecycle, seamlessly navigating through each phase—from initial requirements gathering with key stakeholders to system architecture, design and meticulous development. With a commitment to delivering high-quality solutions at every stage.
          </p>

          <p>
            Effective communication is a skill often underestimated in the field of software development, yet I firmly believe it is paramount. This happens to be a distinctive strength of mine. Being an effective communicator is also incredibly important when working as part of a collaborative development team.
            Whether reviewing code or addressing PR comments, clarifiying user stories or navigating complex technical discussions, effective communication is absolutely key for seamless collaboration and successful outcomes.
          </p>

          <p>
            I excel in analysing and understanding real-world processes, adept at translating them into functional, efficient, and user-friendly software applications. My experience spans various application types, showcasing versatility in problem-solving.
