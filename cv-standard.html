            <p>
              Pragmatic full stack software engineer with 20 years experience, specialising in building and delivering
              high quality bespoke software solutions. My focus is on apps accessed via a browser and/or mobile devices.
              I've been freelance/contracting since 2014.
            </p>

            <p>
              I’ve been writing JS since 2001 which has given me an excellent platform for all things JS and TypeScript.
              I’ve been using React and associated libraries (e.g. Redux, React Router, MaterialUI, React Bootstrap,
              Styled Components etc) for all front-end projects since 2016.
            </p>

            <p>
              I've been working in React Native for building iOS and Android apps since 2017. Most recently working on a
              connected car mobile app to control various aspects of the upcoming range of vehicles for one of the
              world's biggest car manufacturers.
            </p>

            <p>
              In terms of back-end, I’ve been writing C# on .NET since around 2007. I’ve utilised MVC and WebAPI
              extensively during that time, more recently using .NET Core. I have extensive API design, implementation
              and consumption experience. I've also more recently worked on NodeJS projects deployed to AWS.
            </p>

            <p>
              I have lots of experience in database design, maintenance, optimisation and migration. I've plenty of
              recent experience using both SQL (e.g. MS SQL, MySQL) and NoSQL (e.g. DynamoDB) databases.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-6 bg-white">
          <h3 class="border-bottom mt-3 pb-1">Other Skills</h3>
          <p>
            I have extensive experience of every aspect of the software application lifecycle, from requirements
            gathering with key stakeholders, system architecture, design, development, deployment, delivery and
            documentation through to ongoing maintenance and support.
          </p>

          <p>
            Communication is a skill which is often overlooked for software developers but it's actually paramount in my
            opinion. I think this is a particular strong point of mine. Having worked for relatively small agencies has
            always meant wearing lots of different hats and dealing with all kinds of different people/roles. Whether
            negotiating at senior level, dealing with key stakeholders, liasing with project managers etc.
          </p>

          <p>
            Being an effective communicator is also incredibly important when working as part of a development team.
            Whether reviewing code or responding to PR comments, seeking clarity on user stories, requesting or offering
            assistance on complicated technical subjects, effective communication is absolutely key.
          </p>

          <p>
            I've worked on many different types of application which means I've become very accustomed to analysing and
            understanding real-world processes and solving the problem of translating those processess into functional,
            easy to use software applications.

              I enjoy reading and listening to various podcasts. I try to keep up to speed with the latest tech
